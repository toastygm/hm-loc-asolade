Asolade Hundred is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. It is designed to depict
the Asolade hundred in the kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting; however, this area
and set of settlements could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.
Detailed descriptions of the actors has been provided in journal entries to facilitate
conversion to other game systems.
